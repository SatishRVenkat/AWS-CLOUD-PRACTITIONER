- How a website work ?
    - client   ------ (n/w) --------- server 
    - (client Ip address) --------- (server Ip Address)

- Explanation: here browser is accessed through the system(client)


- what is server composed of ?
    - a server contains a cpu's will do some caliculations
    - server also contians RAM which stores the information and retrieve quickly 
    - cpu+ram = brain 
    - storage : data
    - to store the data in a structured way we need a database (so we can easily search it and query it )
    - Network(Router,switch, DNS server) - in server we also need a network

    - Cloud gives all these things on demand 


- The deployment modal of the cloud 


- **** the most important thing in AWS is regions 
    - AWS regions 
    - How to choose an AWS region ??
        - compliance - sometimes the governmet want the data to be local  to the country (Ex:  France)
        - Proximity to customers Latency, If we are having an application in USA we need to deploy in USA in order access it fast  to reduce the latency. For example if we are having users in USA and the application is deployed in australia then there is 

        - Available services within the region : All services are not availale in every region. new services and new features are not available in ery region. 
        - Pricing : varies from region to region 

- **** AWS Global Infrastructure 
        - CONTAINS ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED 
        - if we want to see the information of the resource availability in the regions we can check here   in AWS REGIONAL SERVICES 



## Section 4: IAM (Identity Access Management)

- IAM - Users & Groups Imp points 
    - IAM is a global service, we no need to select the region. When we create a user in IAM it will be available everywhere 
    - users are people with in the organization and can be grouped 
    - ** Imp -> Groups can contain only users, not other groups 
    - some users no need to be in a group, indivudual users 
    - user can belong to multiple groups   


- IAM Permissions 
    - Users/ groups we give permissions to access the AWS resources 
    - Users/groups are assigned with JSON documents called policies. This JSON object is just describing that what resources that the user is having access, For what resources user is allowed 
    - These policies helps us to define the permissions of the users 
    - In AWS we apply a principle called Least Previlage Principle: Dont give more permissions than a user needs 
    -  

- why we need a user ? 
    - when we create a account we will get it with a ID , it is not a best practice to use with a root account, if we create a user so we can use our account safely 
    -  If the user is not me then we need to create an autogenerated password
